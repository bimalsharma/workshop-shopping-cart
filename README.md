(Still In development)  Shopping Cart Galen Workshop
======================

The idea of the workshop is like this. Imagine you are a QA engineer or a Front-end developer in a team and you are told to make a responsive webpage "Shopping Cart". Product owner comes to you and gives you this sketch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galenframework/workshop-shopping-cart/master/docs/sketch-scan.jpeg
In the workshop we will simulate this situation and will try to come up with the approach for "tests first, implementation after". The message we try to bring is that "good test automation starts in the beginning and not in the end of the project". The development of the website will be split into small iterations and for each iteration you have to write a test and then we will check it agains a website iteration. The starting point is only a webpage skeleton, then we go into headers, then we go into navigation panel. An so on and so on.
We will prepare the website for all iterations so we kind of like faking that we are developing it but what we are going to do is just writing tests.
